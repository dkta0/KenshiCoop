# CoopHarness.psm1 - shared launch/environment helpers for the KenshiCoop test
# harness. Phase 2 extraction: the per-scenario ENVIRONMENT (channel A/B knobs +
# log-only diagnostic traces) is now OWNED by the manifest (scripts/scenarios.psd1
# `DiagEnv` block per scenario) and applied here, so run_test.ps1 and
# run_lan_test.ps1 stop carrying duplicated, drifting name-match chains and the
# plugin's Config.cpp stops hard-coding scenario names.
#
# Design:
#   * DiagEnv is MODE-AGNOSTIC (host and join get the same knobs) - every entry
#     here is a channel toggle or a trace flag, never an endpoint/role value.
#   * The applier is HERMETIC: it clears the whole managed keyset to "" first,
#     then applies the scenario's DiagEnv, so no knob leaks from a previous
#     scenario when several run in one process.
#   * Clearing a channel key to "" means the plugin's Config default applies
#     (envOr("...","1")!="0" for the always-on channels; the scenario==""/setup
#     auto rules for invSync/worldSync). DiagEnv only carries the DELTAS from
#     those defaults (a probe forcing a channel OFF, or a scenario forcing
#     invSync/worldSync ON), exactly the set Config.cpp used to name.
